# Real-time quiz app
This is a quick-attemt at a real time (websockets) quiz web-app. Meant to be used at for instance office-parties, participants answer questions on their phones with scores being displayed on a tv or projector.

Backend built with node.js + express + socket.io
Frontend in Vue.js

The code is not great, but it works. I didn't have a lot of time to put this together.
